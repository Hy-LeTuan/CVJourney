    "\n",
    "Often times in professional software development, there are multiple teams working on a single project at the same time, and these teams will likely be working on different components of the software.\n",
    "1. This can quickly lead to different versions of the project existing at the same time, where one team might not use the most updated version of the software published by another team that has just completed their part.\n",
    "2. To try and implement new features, teams risk breaking the existing code that is running perfectly fine.\n",
    "3. There is no way of knowing who did what and who contributed to certain part of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why in today's software sceen, we use a version control tool. A version control tool allows us to solve the problems mentioned above by mantaining the whole history of change of the software. Every change on the software's code will be documented, and the history is stored as a graph where changes causes another node to be added to the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows developers to branch off at certain time of changes, ensuring that no teams operate on new features that have not been tested. This also allows us to see who did the changes and allows us to have a definitive main version that is stable while also having multiple versions testing out new features, which are all tracked by the version control tool."

These files are files that was modified by us, and so we want Git to record these changes. Next, we **commit** these files into the version history. After committing these files, the version history will be updated with the changes we have made."

    "where the `-m` flag is where you put the commit message. This flag is a required flag as any changes committed into the software's history has to have a message explaining what the changes do. There are many best practices to look for how to commit files, how many files to commit at the same time and how to write a commit message. However, the most intuitive way of thinking about it is that every commit **has a single purpose** and that changes should only serve this purpose and nothing else."
