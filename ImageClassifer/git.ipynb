    "Often times in professional software development, there are multiple teams working on a single project at the same time, and these teams will likely be working on different components of the software.\n",
    "1. This can quickly lead to different versions of the project existing at the same time, where one team might not use the most updated version of the software published by another team that has just completed their part.\n",
    "2. To try and implement new features, teams risk breaking the existing code that is running perfectly fine.\n",
    "3. There is no way of knowing who did what and who contributed to certain part of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why in today's software sceen, we use a version control tool. A version control tool allows us to solve the problems mentioned above by mantaining the whole history of change of the software. Every change on the software's code will be documented, and the history is stored as a graph where changes causes another node to be added to the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows developers to branch off at certain time of changes, ensuring that no teams operate on new features that have not been tested. This also allows us to see who did the changes and allows us to have a definitive main version that is stable while also having multiple versions testing out new features, which are all tracked by the version control tool."

    "Git is a version control tool developed by Linus Tovalds, and it is completely open source and free. Git is one of the most popular version control tool in the world, and is widely integrated into many different tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Git, we have to install it by navigating to its [website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and installing it according to your operating system. On Windows, I recommend you use the **Chocolatey** package manager, similar to any package manager on a Unix operating system to make the installation process for these tools much easier.\n",

    "A very important concept in Git is the `repository` concept. A repository is just a folder that contains all of your code and the `.git` to store all of the commit history. Later on when you read about Github, the `repository` will be divided into 2 types: a `local repository` and a `remote repository`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `local repository` is a Git repository that lives on your local computer, while a `remote repository` is a Git repository that is uploaded onto the Internet. Git provides us a lot of tools to communicate and exchange information between the local and the remote repository, which allows multiple developers to share the same codebase and version control history."

These files are files that was modified by us, and so we want Git to record these changes. Next, we **commit** these files into the version history.

There are many best practices to look for how to commit files, how many files to commit at the same time and how to write a commit message. However, the most intuitive way of thinking about it is that every commit **has a single purpose** and that changes should only serve this purpose and nothing else."

    "Think of Git as a timeline graph, where the commits are nodes that marks a certain moment in the project. The **main** timeline is the standard version of the codebase, yet we can **branch off** from this main timeline to other alternative timeline, kind of like the multiverse. Each time we **branch off**, we create a *branch* in our codebase. The main branch and other branch can exist at the same time, and they can be **merged** together.\n",
